# Description

A terminal based program that will ask the user various questions based on employee members that they wish to add to their team. A html file with profile cards displaying this information will then be made.
My motivation for making this project was to better understand how object oriented programming works, and to get a better grasp of jest and test driven development.

# Installation

This project cannot be run on a webpage and must be used in the source code.

1: Download repo from github. 2: Save where desired. 3: Open file with a text editor of your choice.

# Usage

Before using ensure that you have node installed. You may also need to install the "Inquirer" npm, and "jest" if you wish to run tests.

1: Open the script.js file, this is found in assets/js/script.js. 2: Open the terminal and ensure that you are in the correct directory and have installed the required npm programs. 3: Type "node script.js" in the terminal. 4: Next answer all the prompts you are given. If you wish to add more members then select yes when prompted. 5: Once all promps are answered and you do not wish to add more members simply say no when asked if you want to continue, then a html file will be made in the base directory. Copy this file and save it wherever you please. Just remember to also take the css file linked to it too.

# Testing

If you wish to test the program then open up the terminal inside script.js and type: npm test.
This will run jest and it will test if the constructors are working
